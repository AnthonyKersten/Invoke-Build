# Invoke-Build Release Notes

## v3.0.0

Build script parameters are specified as Invoke-Build dynamic parameters.
The parameter `Parameters` was removed. This change is breaking in some
cases, see [#29](https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build/issues/29).

Avoided cryptic errors on invoking scripts with invalid syntax and on resuming
builds with an invalid checkpoint file.
